Helmet Detection (YOLOv8 + Webcam)

Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.
It detects people from your webcam feed and simulates helmet detection on top of their heads.

Features
Real-time webcam feed with bounding boxes.
Detects people using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
Simulates helmets on detected persons.
Ready for extension to custom helmet detection using a trained YOLOv8 model.
